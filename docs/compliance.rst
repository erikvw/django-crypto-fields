==========

This module adds features that enable your system with field-level database encryption. With this approach, sensitive information is rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals for “data in use” (e.g. data being analyzed by statisticians), “data in motion” (e.g. data being transferred between data entry and storage points) and “data at rest” (e.g. data in storage in the database).

`Clinic EDC <https://clinicedc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ projects require this module, `edc-auth <https://github.com/edc-auth>`_ and `django-simple-history <https://github.com/django-commons/django-simple-history>`_.
