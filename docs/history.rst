=======

``django-crypto-fields`` has been used in audited research projects that use the "Clinic EDC" to build EDCs for data collection and management. Data collected in CLinic EDC projects are considered "source documents". ``django-crypto-field`` adds field level encryption for sensitive field values such as names, identifiers, dob, etc (PII). Authorized study personnel accessing the data through the application can see PII. Downstream data management staff and statisticians accessing the database directly cannot.
